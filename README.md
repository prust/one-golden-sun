# One Golden Sun

This is an action/construction game created for a game-making competition called Ludum Dare. I hope to make it a co-op game, but I'm not planning on working on that aspect of it during the 3-day competition.

I’ve always liked construction games, like Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne and Minecraft, as well as action games (dual-stick shooters, etc). So my plan is to make a game that involves both. It’ll be a bit futuristic/sci-fi in theme, though I’m not sure how much that will come through. I’ll be using game art that was originally from an unreleased real-time strategy game called Hard Vacuum in 1993 and was donated to the public by Daniel Cook in 2005: http://lunar.lostgarden.com/game_HardVacuum.htm.
